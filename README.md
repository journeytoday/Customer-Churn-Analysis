# Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Problem Description :

The Telco Customer Churn dataset consists of data from a telecommunications company. The objective 
of this project is to predict customer churn, which is when a customer cancels their service or stops 
doing business with a company. The dataset contains information about customer demographics, 
account information, services used, and whether or not the customer churned. The goal of this project is 
to build a model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn, so that the company 
can take steps to prevent it.

## Requirements:

• Python 3.x
• Jupyter Notebook or any other python environment
• Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn

## Deliverables:

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report
• Data Preprocessing report
• Feature Selection and Engineering report
• Model Building and Evaluation report
• Final report with conclusions and recommendations for the company.

## Background: 

Customer churn is a common problem faced by businesses across many industries. In the 
telecommunications industry, customer churn can have a significant impact on revenue and profitability. 
Therefore, it is important for telecommunications companies to identify customers who are likely to 
churn and take steps to retain them. This project will use machine learning techniques to build a 
predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn.
